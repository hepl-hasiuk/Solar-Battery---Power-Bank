The final report presents the design and construction of a battery management circuit (BMS) for
a solar power system. The project aims to exploit solar energy as well as a simple
USB Type-C charging to recharge a battery, after which that battery will be used
like a simple power bank to recharge a smartphone or other. The report addresses the
key system components including BQ24045DSQR BMS, MCP1640 boost, and protection
against discharge AP9221. PCB design is detailed, followed by testing and testing
of improvement.
